This repo is following the Odin Project's guide on creating a simple HTML website for a recipe.

While I'm very familiar with the content of this lesson, I hope to gain familiarity with a basic Git and HTML workflow, and better understand how to organize my files and repositories, as well as practice writing proper commit messages.
