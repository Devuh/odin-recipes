This repo is following the Odin Project's guide on creating a simple HTML website for a recipe.

While I'm very familiar with the content of this lesson, I hope to gain familiarity with a basic Git and HTML workflow, and better understand how to organize my files and repositories, as well as practice writing proper commit messages.

The banana bread recipe was copied from https://www.noracooks.com/banana-bread/.

The other two recipes were generated using ChatGPT. I wanted practice creating a functional website and used ChatGPT to save time writing redundant code.
